# Contributing

## Reporting Issues & Asking Questions

Before opening an issue, please search the [issue tracker](https://github.com/Venom0us/Emberpoint/issues) to make sure your issue hasn't already been discussed before.

### Bugs & Improvements

I encourage you to open issues to discuss improvements, architecture, theory, implementation, performance, principles, etc.

## Development

Visit the [issue tracker](https://github.com/Venom0us/Emberpoint/issues) to find a list of open issues that need attention.

To prevent multiple people working on the same issue and causing conflicts, please put a comment on the issue.

Repo can be easily cloned, you can work on seperate feature branches which can then be open for a pull request to master,
which I will review personally.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Venom0us/Emberpoint.git
```

## Sending a Pull Request

The whole purpose behind this project is to get people contributing however large or small the contribution. Whether it be _fixing a bug_ or _adding a feature_ submit changes via a Pull Request.

In general, the contribution workflow looks like this:

- Be assigned to an existing issue or open a new issue in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/Venom0us/Emberpoint/issues).
- Copy the repo, and create a feature branch. We usually go with something like "feature/issue#number-initialsOfUser" ex: "feature/issue#100-ven"
- Make your development changes
- Make sure all tests are green, and your feature is sufficiently covered by tests.
- Submit a pull request, referencing any issues it addresses in the comment of the PR.

Please try to keep your pull request focused in scope and avoid including unrelated commits.

After you have submitted your pull request, I'll try to get back to you as soon as possible. I may suggest some changes or improvements.

Thank you for contributing!
